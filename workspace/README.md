# Workspace

This is a directory to put the temporary files and credentials that
should not be checked into Git repository. Checking in your temporary
files and credentials is extremely dangerous. Malicious people are 
scanning all public repositories for credentials and passwords, and 
it's the matter of minutes when they will use your credentials to start
mining for bitcoin and all sorts of other nefarious activities, using
your credentials. Be careful!


There's .gitignore file that should ignore all files in this folder.
